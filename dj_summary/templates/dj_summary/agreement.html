<h1>WMFO DJ Agreement for {{ semester }}</h1>
<pre>
By signing here, I agree to the following:

1. Rules: I have read the WMFO Constitution and the DJ Handbook. I understand that these documents and
this contract represent the binding rules and policies of WMFO.

2. Property: I will not attempt to fix, modify, or remove any equipment or property at WMFO without written permission from the WMFO
Executive Board.

3. Alcohol/Drugs: WMFO has a zero tolerance drugs and alcohol policy. I understand that if I or my guests are found to be in the
possession of drugs and/or alcohol and/or under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol while in the station, I will be subject to
immediate dismissal.

4. Discrimination and Sexual Harassment: I understand that violations of Tufts Universityâ€™s official non-discrimination and/or sexual
harassment policies will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action including suspension or dismissal, as well as
criminal prosecution.

5. Shows: If applying for a show, I have fully completed the attached scheduling form. I understand that I might not keep my current time
slot or get a show at all, and that the final decision lies entirely with the Programming Director and Executive Board, who are
responsible for creating the semester program schedule. I understand that the Executive Board may need to cancel my show at various
times during the season to accommodate special events.

6. Profanity: I am aware of and will abide by WMFO's Profanity Policy, available at:
https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/General_Policies/Profanity%2C_Indecency%2C_and_Obscenity

7. Spinitron: I have created a Spinitron account and recognize that I must log all material I play on air at the time it is played.

8. Subs: If assigned a show time, I understand that I must attend every show on time and for its full duration, or find a substitute by sending
an email to wmfo-sublist@googlegroups.com. I understand that there is a maximum of three substitutions allowed per season. If
something unexpected happens, or if I will be otherwise absent for more than three shows and need more substitutions, I will contact the
Programming Director as soon as possible.

9. Volunteering: All regular DJs are required to complete at least five hours of volunteering per semester, no more than two of which may
count from subbing. DJs without regular shows (subs) must complete at least three non-subbing volunteer hours per semester to retain
station access. I understand that failure to complete volunteer hours will affect my station access rights and show time(s) in the future.

10. Access: The Programming Director is responsible for the activation of my card access each semester. After activation, if my card does
not work, it is my responsibility to email the Programming Director at pd@wmfo.org as soon as possible.

11. Newgroups: I have joined and will regularly read the following two Google groups:
WMFO-STAFF: http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff
WMFO-SUBLIST: http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist
For more info and to view optional groups, I will visit: https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups

12. Violations: If I violate any guidelines set forth above or modified by subsequent official WMFO Executive Board e-mails, I understand
that my behavior is punishable at the discretion of the WMFO Executive Board.
